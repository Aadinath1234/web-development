    # MOngoDb stores data as documents , so it is known as document oriented database.
    # Data is stored as BSON , bson is like json but in bson type of variable is declared like integer , float, etc.
    # some terms :
         # terms in rdbms(mySQl) v/s  mongodb
              # database = database
              # Tables = Collections
               # Rows = Documents


    # mongod is the host process for the database.
    # mongo is the command line shell that connects to   mongod.
    # mongod is works as a plate and mongo as a spoon.
    # its default port is 27017.
    # when you run mongo for invalid host then it will fail to connect.
