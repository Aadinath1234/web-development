    //general way to write function:

    /*
    function greet(){
        console.log('Good morning');
    }
    greet();//output: Good morning.

    */  


   /*
     //short way to write the function:(Arrow Function):  
         greet = ()=> {
            console.log("Good morning bhai");
         }
         greet();
         // => is called the arrow function.

         //output: Good morning bhai

         */

         setTimeout(() => {
            console.log("we are inside settimeout");
         }, 3000);// inside settimeout we have arrow function and after 3 seconds your function will run.
          // after calling sum(valuefor a, valuefor b) , it will sum the objects like: sum(3,5) in output you will get 8.


*/ 




let greet = ()=> {
            console.log('Good morning');
         }

         //shortest way to write function:
         let sum2 = (a,b)=> a+b;
         // here you don't have to write return function .
         greet();
         let half = a=> a/2;
         // here you don't have to write the parenthesis for a , and this is only applicable for single arguments. , the output will be half(40): 20.

         // when you do not have any arguments then do this:
         let y = ()=> console.log("good happening.");
         //output: after calling this y(), you will get good happening in the output.
         setTimeout(() => {
            console.log("We are inside settimeout");
         }, 1000); 
         // output: sum2(2,3) = 5.
