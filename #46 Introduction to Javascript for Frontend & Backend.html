<!--#javascript is a client side scripting 
    language which means that it is work for
   clientside  to write scripts .
    #it is used to make web pages alive.
    # it is used to programmatically perform
       actions within the page.
    #When javascript was created, it was initially
     called  "LiveScript" because it provides life 
       to web pages.
    # java script is named javascript because  at that 
      time java was very popular so they named it javascript 
       instead livescript. 
        this is the confusion thing that javascript and java 
         are the same languages but actually javascript is 
           completely different language from java.
    # javascript can execute not only in the browser but
       also on the server.
    # we use javascript as a clientside as well
       as serverside language.
    # javascript has evolved greatly as a language
      and is now used  not only for websites but
     also other tasks are performed by it. 
        so it is very useful at now times.
    
    # javascript goes to browser then it is executed.
      so backend should safe and low level cpu 
    permissions are not given by javascript 
      .
    # add new html and change existing html
       from DOM(document object model , which includes 
          html nav div section etc.)
    # React to the events (like response from server
          , any key pressed by client , or any mouse movement.)

    # Ajax requests comes to browser that  should listen 
      and content comes to the browser that should be 
        populated to dom as and when it required.
        
    # Get and set Cookies: 
         browser sends data to the server only at
           once , it is not needed that browser 
             sends data to sever every time you logged in 
               or used internet through browser.
               and you can use local storage in js, 
                 small data can store inside it.

    # what js can't do in-browser:
          # read/write to & from computer hard disk. means it cannot 
            read or write inside your computer hard disk.
          # you cannot use cross side data .
            if it is done which means you can read the message and 
                content of other party.(same origin policy.)

          # summary : # it can access permitted resources.
                      # it cannot access your computer or your
                        personal data or private data. 
           

        

       # What makes javascript unique?:
           # it has support of html/css .
           # for the simple things it gives simple Api(application programming interface.)
           # it supports major modern browsers.
           # javascript is maintained by the community.
           # ECMA is initiated in 1997 and  provides update of the javascript like any updation 
             done in js will be informed to the user.
                 # in 1997 it's first version(ecma)
                 # 2nd version 1998
                 # 3rd version in 1999.
                 # latest is ECMA script in 2015.
                 # then 2016 and 2017 & 2018.
                 # motive of the ecma is make js better and updation in
                   its feature as per required by modern times.
