            How to protect yourself
        </h2>
        <p>
            To prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the following: 

Get vaccinated when a vaccine is available to you.
Stay at least 1 metre apart from others, even if they donâ€™t appear to be sick.
Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not possible or when in poorly ventilated settings.
Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.
Wash your hands regularly with soap and water or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub.
Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
If you feel unwell, stay home and self-isolate until you recover.
